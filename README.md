# Blackbaud SKY Developer Public Application using Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.10.

## Getting started

1. Update the `clientId` and `subscriptionKey` variables in `shared/services/authorization.service.ts` to the keys obtained from your Developer Account and registered application. 
2. This example takes advantage of the SKY Developer Cohort. You may may need to change the `constituentId` in `home/home.component.ts` to a valid constituent ID from the environment you selected during OAuth Authorization.

## Development server

If you are building your first Angular application, follow the instructions for setting up your local environment for Angular development. Below are some additional details you may find helpful for setting up your environment.

Angular CLI
SKY UX requires Angular CLI version 17. To check your version, run `ng version` from the command line. To install Angular CLI version 14, run `npm install -g @angular/cli@17`.

Node.js
SKY UX requires [Node.js version 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/). To check your version, run `node -v` from the command line.

In addition, SKY UX recommends Node Version Manager (NVM) to wrap your Node.js installation. NVM installs Node.js in your user directory to avoid permissions-related issues, and it also allows you to easily upgrade and manage multiple Node.js versions.

For Mac OS X and Linux, follow the installation and update instructions in the README.md file for the NVM GitHub repo.
For Windows, follow the installation and update instructions in the README.md file for the NVM for Windows GitHub repo.
NPM

SKY UX requires NPM version 9, which is the default JavaScript package manager for Node.js. As of Node.js version 0.6.3, it is bundled and installed automatically with the environment. To check your version, run `npm -v` from the command line. To install a specific version, run `npm install` globally and specify the version.

Run `npm install` to install all the needed dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Using the application

1. If you have no SKY API access tokens, then the application will automatically redirect you to the Blackbaud SKY API OAuth flow to authorize the application in the environment of your choosing. If you do not have access to your own Blackbaud environment, you can [request access](mailto:skyapi@blackbaud.com) to the following SKY Developer Cohort sandboxes.
2. After gaining an access token, you will be redirected to the home page where constituent data is displayed.
3. You may create a new access token or clear the existing access tokens.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
